# Forest of the Lost

*This game was made of Ludum Dare 51! Check out the page [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/forest-of-the-lost).*


## Introduction

Children keep going missing. The only things connecting the disappearances is the forest: The Forest of the Lost. You are a detective ðŸ”Ž tasked with finding Lily, the latest of the missing children. This sinister forest holds mysteries never before uncovered by human hands. Will you uncover them? or will you become lost yourself?

Forest of the Lost is a story-driven cosmic horror exploration game. The goal of the game is to uncover the mysteries of the forest while avoiding monsters that hide amongst the trees and bushes. **Every 10 seconds** they change hiding spots. Try to remember where they are to avoid them.

## Development Information

Children of the Lost is the 2nd game written [WizEngine](https://github.com/WheezyWiseWizards/WizEngine): a custom [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) fork written in C++ that was developed for our Ludum Dare entries. The engine supports porting to the Nintendo Switch (Homebrew) (like our LD50 entry [Final Forest](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/final-forest)). We just focused on the desktop ports for this entry.
